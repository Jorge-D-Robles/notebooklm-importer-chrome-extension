# Privacy Policy

**NotebookLM Importer** is an open-source Chrome extension. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.

## Data Collection and Usage

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.**

*   **Local Storage**: The extension saves your preferred NotebookLM URL locally on your device using Chrome's storage API (`chrome.storage.sync`). This data never leaves your browser and is not sent to any external servers.
*   **No Analytics**: We do not use any third-party analytics or tracking scripts.
*   **No Remote Servers**: The extension operates entirely client-side. It interacts directly with the NotebookLM website (`notebooklm.google.com`) from your browser to perform the actions you request (adding sources).
